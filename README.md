# karnaugh-map
This package draws [karnaugh maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map) with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 variables.
It also contains commands for filling the karnaugh map with terms semi-automatically or manually.
Last but not least it contains commands for drawing implicants on top of the map.
Below is an example of a two variable karnaugh map.

## Development
The karnaugh-map package source is hosted at [https://github.com/2pi/karnaugh-map](https://github.com/2pi/karnaugh-map) as well as the [bugtracker](https://github.com/2pi/karnaugh-map/issues).

## Tests
    ./test.sh
Testing consists of building the pdf output from the test files, and then comparing them to how they are expected to look like.
Comparison is done with help from [diff-pdf](https://github.com/vslavik/diff-pdf).
All of this is done by running the `test.sh` file from the project root folder.
If there is a difference, between the actual and expected output, a diff will be written to the folder `test/result`.
